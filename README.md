The Speedy Cab modification to include NTP graph into https://github.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090 
includes modified install script and other components.

# graphs1090
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090/screenshots/messages_24h.png)
Graphs for dump1090-fa (based on dump1090-tools by mutability)

Also works for other dump1090 variants supplying stats.json

## Installation / Update to current version:
```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090/master/install.sh)"
```

## Configuration (optional):
Edit the configuration file to change graph layout options, for example size:
```
sudo nano /etc/default/graphs1090
```
Ctrl-x to exit, y (yes) and enter to save.

Reset configuration to defaults:
```
sudo cp /usr/share/graphs1090/default-config /etc/default/graphs1090
```


## View the graphs:

Click the following URL and replace the IP address with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you installed combine1090 on.

### Reducing writes to the sd-card

The rrd databases get written to every minute, this adds up to around 100 Megabytes written per hour.
While most modern SD-cards should handle this for 10 or more years easily, you can reduce the amount written if you want to.
Per default linux writes data to disk after a maximum of 30 seconds in the cache.
Increasing this to 10 minutes reduces actual disk writes to around 10 Megabytes per hour.

Don't change this if you handle data on the Raspberry Pi which you don't want to lose the last 10 minutes of.

Increasing this write delay to 10 minutes can be done like this (takes effect after reboot):
```
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/07-dirty.conf <<EOF
vm.dirty_ratio = 40
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 30
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 60000
EOF
```

Because i don't mind losing data on my Raspberry Pi when it loses power, i have set this to one hour:
```
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/07-dirty.conf <<EOF
vm.dirty_ratio = 40
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 30
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 360000
EOF
```



### Non-standard configuration:

If your local map is not reachable at /dump1090-fa or /dump1090, you can edit the following the file to input the URL of your local map:

```/etc/collectd/collectd.conf```

Find this section:

```
<Plugin python>
        ModulePath "/usr/share/graphs1090"
        LogTraces true
        Import "dump1090"
        <Module dump1090>
                <Instance localhost>
                        URL "http://localhost/dump1090-fa"
                </Instance>
        </Module>
</Plugin>
```
And change the URL to where your dump1090 webinterface is located.
After changing the URL, restart collectd:
```
sudo systemctl restart collectd
```

### Resetting the database format

This might be a good idea if you changed from the adsb receiver project graphs and kept the data.
Also if you upgraded at a somewhen July 15th to July 16th 2019. Had a bad setting removing maximum data keeping for some part of the data.

```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090/master/install.sh)"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y screen
sudo screen /usr/share/graphs1090/new-format.sh
```


### Known bugs:

##### disk graphs with kernel >= 4.19 don't work due to a collectd bug
https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/2951

possible sollution: install new collectd version:
```
wget -O /tmp/collectd.deb http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/collectd/collectd-core_5.8.1-1.3_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/collectd.deb
```


### Deinstallation:
```
sudo bash /usr/share/graphs1090/uninstall.sh
```

### nginx configuration:

```
location /graphs1090/graphs/ {
  alias /run/graphs1090/;
}

location /graphs1090 {
  alias /usr/share/graphs1090/html/;
  try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```


### no http config

in collectd.conf:
```
  URL "file:///usr/local/share/dump1090-data"
```
commands:
```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/dump1090-data
sudo ln -s /run/dump1090-fa /usr/local/share/dump1090-data/data
```


### Backup and Restore (same architecture)

Backup this folder:
```
/var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost/
```

I'm not exactly sure how you would do that on Windows.
Probably with FileZilla using the SSH/SCP protocol.

Install graphs1090 if you haven't already.

On the new card copy the localhost folder to /tmp using FileZilla again.

Then copy it back to its place like this:
```
sudo systemctl stop collectd
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/collectd/rrd/
sudo cp -r -T /tmp/localhost /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost/
sudo systemctl restart collectd graphs1090
```

This should be all that is required, no guarantees though!

### Backup and Restore (different architecture, for example moving from RPi to x86 or the other way around)

Basically the same procedure as above, but with this difference:

Before doing the backup, run this command:

```
sudo /usr/share/graphs1090/rrd-dump.sh /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost/
```

This creates XML files from the database files in the same directory which can be later restored to database files on the target system.

Complete the process described above (backup the folder, then copy it back to its place on the new card).
Now run this command:

```
sudo /usr/share/graphs1090/rrd-restore.sh /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost/
```

Again no guarantees, but this should work.
